# Python Conditionals 


This is a short exersize to get use to conditionals with python.


Conditionals
1.	Driving Age
a.	Declare a variable and assign it the value of the legal driving age in the United States.
b.	Declare a variable to store a user's age. Use the built-in Python input() function to retrieve the user’s age via user input.
c.	If the user’s age is greater than or equal to the legal driving age in the United States, then print to the console “You are legally able to drive.”
d.	If the user’s age is less than the legal driving age in the United States, print to the console “You are not old enough to drive yet.”
2.	Random Number 
a.	Declare a variable to store a random number between 0 and 10. You will need to do some research to determine how to generate a random number in Python.
i.	A good search term to use: “random number Python”
b.	If the number is between 0 and 2, print to the console “0 or 1 or 2”
c.	If the number is between 3 and 5, print to the console “3 or 4 or 5”
d.	If the number is between 6 and 8, print to the console “6 or 7 or 8”
e.	If the number is equal to 9 or 10, print to the console “9 or 10”
3.	NFL Teams
a.	Declare a variable to store an NFL team name. Use the built-in Python input() function to retrieve a user’s inputted favorite NFL team.
b.	Build out a conditional for “Bears”, in which if selected it will print to the console “Quarterback much?”
c.	Build out a conditional for “Vikings”, in which if selected it will print to the console “Loud noises!”
d.	Build out a conditional for “Lions”, in which if selected it will print to the console “LOL! They bad!” 
e.	Build out a conditional for “Packers” in which if selected it will print to the console “Best team in the world! Actually, the universe!” 
f.	Build out a “default” conditional to print to the console “Pick a different team” in the scenario where a user doesn’t input “Bears”, “Vikings”, “Lions”, or “Packers”.
